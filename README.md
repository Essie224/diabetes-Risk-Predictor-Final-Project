# 🩺 Type-2 Diabetes Risk Prediction App

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Type-2 Diabetes Risk Prediction App** is a machine learning project built to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on lifestyle and health factors,
the app provides quick and reliable predictions that could assist in early detection and prevention strategies.

This project helped me explore the end-to-end data science workflow, from data cleaning and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA),
model training, and finally, building an interactive app for predictions.


## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Type-2 diabetes** is one of the most common chronic health conditions worldwide. Many people remain undiagnosed until complications occur. 
By analyzing patient data, this project demonstrates how machine learning can:
	•	Identify key risk factors
	•	Predict diabetes likelihood with high accuracy
	•	Potentially support preventive healthcare measures


## ⚙ Features
	•	📊 Data preprocessing & cleaning on diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv
	•	🔍 Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
	•	🤖 Machine learning classification model with 98% accuracy (0.98 F1-score)
	•	🧮 Predictive output: Diabetes Risk or No Risk
	•	🌐 User-friendly app interface (Streamlit) for real-time predictions


## 📂 Dataset
	•	File: diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv
